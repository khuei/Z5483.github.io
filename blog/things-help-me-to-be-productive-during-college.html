        <p>All the tools that maximized my productivity during college. Configuration files

        <h3>GNU/Linux</h3>
        <p>
        Linux opened up a whole world of possibility in term of customization and tooling.
        During college, I had to use various types of tools and softwares for software development,
        and it is so much easier to install and integrate them in a Linux environment.
        </p>

      <div id="tiling-window-manager" class="blog-page-section">
        <h3>Tiling Window Manager</h3>
        <p>Tiling Window Manager removed the need to use a mouse everytime I
        need to create or move windows. It also allows me quickly switch
        workspaces. Overall, I enjoy the ability to just keep my hands on the
        keyboard while simutaneously quickly opening/moving/switching windows
        as needed</p>
      </div>
      <div id="vim" class="blog-page-section">
        <h3>Vim/Neovim</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of college, I mainly use Vim, but I later switched
        to Neovim for the Treesitter and Language Server Protocol
        integration. The quick navigation and refactoring ability of Neovim are
        so useful when programming. Again, I do not need to move my hands away
        from the keyword to use this tool. Additionally, I find the ability to
        apply regular expressions to texts extremely useful</p>
      </div>
      <div id="aliases" class="blog-page-section">
        <h3>Aliases</h3>
        <p>Having aliases for terminal and git commands boost my ability to
        instanetously perform complex actions. Especially with git commands, I
        constantly use aliases for rebasing, branching, and displaying trees
        with useful visual/information</p>
      </div>
      <div id="terminal" class="blog-page-section">
        <h3>Terminal Styling</h3>
        <p>I modified my command line prompt to show the status of git
        repository and the current branch name. The different status are:
        modified, untracked, and committed. In addition, I also make my prompt
        to be asynchronous to avoid hold up while working with large git
        repository.

        I also added the ability to switch between multiple terminal colorscheme with a
        single command. I find it cool as I often gets tired of one colorscheme
        if I used it too much. It is also helpful for quickly switch between
        dark and light mode depends on the lighting of where I am working
        at</p>

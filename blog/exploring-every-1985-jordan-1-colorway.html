        with Nike but also ignited a sneaker revolution that continues to shape

        <h3>1. Black/Red ("Bred")</h3>
        <p>The Air Jordan 1 Black/Red colorway, often referred to as "Bred" for
        black and red, is the one that started it all. Its story is steeped in
        controversy, as the NBA initially banned the shoe due to its bold and
        unconventional color scheme. This ban only fueled the sneaker's
        popularity, setting the stage for the rise of the Air Jordan line.
        Michael Jordan defiantly wore the Bred colorway on the court, creating
        a legendary moment that resonates with fans to this day.</p>

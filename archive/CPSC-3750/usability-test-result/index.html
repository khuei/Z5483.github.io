          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
          This article describes the result of the usuability test on my audio changer application.
          The link to the application is:
          <a href="https://khuen.net/archive/CPSC-3750/audio-changer">https://khuen.net/archive/CPSC-3750/audio-changer</a>.
          In the test, I had one of my less technologically-inclined friend to
          perform a set of given tasks. I observed how my friend comprehend and
          navigate the application to identify potential improvements.

          <h3>Task List</h3>
          <p>
            Here is the task list for my friend to perform:
            <ul>
              <li>Infer the content of the audio based on information on the website</li>
              <li>Play the audio and navigate to the 3 minutes 18 seconds mark</li>
              <li>Using the tag menu to select and play tag #4</li>
              <li>Create a new tag at the 2 minutes 4 seconds mark</li>
              <li>Delete the created tag</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="task-lists" class="blog-page-section">
          <h3>Observation</h3>
          <p>
          Task:
          <ul>
            <li>
              My friend was able to correctly infer that the audio is a 5
              minutes countdown. She precisely guessed that the text above the
              progress bar is the audio filename due to the ".mp3" extension.
              <br><br>
              An improvement I can make here is to add a label for the filename
              text for the users to quickly locate the name of the audio being
              played.
            </li>
            <li>
              My friend intuitively dragged the ball in the progress bar to
              navigate to certain points in the audio. She didn't often use
              the 5 second forward or rewind buttons.
            </li>
            <li>
              In this task, the friend was confused at the meaning of the
              background highlight for the tag. However, She was able to
              comprehend that the audio was being played at the spot of the tag
              by looking at the audio progress bar and listening to the audio.
              <br><br>
              An improvement I can make here is adding a legend to shows the
              meaning for each tag background highlight. Another one is adding
              alert for which tag is selected to play. A minor improvement I
              noticed that can be made is keeping the column name row in the
              tag menu always visible, so the users can always use it to infer
              the content of each column.
            </li>
            <li>
              The button title misled my friend into thinking that she specify
              the time at which the tag is placed. However, this is not true
              since it can only create tag at the audio current time. To remedy
              this, I need to change the button title for better clarification.
              <br><br>
              My friend was also not sure if her tag was created successfully
              until she scrolled through the tag menu to see the newly created
              tag. Another improvement would be to provide a message confirming
              the tag creation
            </li>
            <li>
              For deleting the tag, my friend intuitively used the trash can
              icon to delete the specified tag.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="task-lists" class="blog-page-section">
          <h3>Improvements to be Made</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Add filename label for the filename text</li>
            <li>Add legend for background highlight keys</li>
            <li>Add messages for action confirmation of creating/selecting tags</li>
            <li>modify create tag button title to correctly indicate tag will be created at audio current time</li>
            <li>Keep column name row visible at all time</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

                        <p>French Kiwi Juice, or FKJ for short, is the moniker of Vincent
            Fenton, a nod to his Gallic mother and New Zealander father. He
            grew up in a small French village outside of Tours, isolated from
            his friends, and so he turned to music for company. He got hooked
            on his parents&apos; records by Pink Floyd, Billie Holliday, Nina Simone
            and Queen, and took up guitar; then, aged seven, the saxophone. &quot;I
            would play with whatever toys were around, and that helped develop
            my imagination, and then that evolved into making instruments &ndash; I
            found whatever I could and started putting it together,&quot; he said of
            his rudimentary one&ndash;man bands.</p>
            <p>That one&ndash;man&ndash;band mentality has persisted, collecting
            instruments as he goes, though he&apos;s never been formally trained;
            instead developing his own ear. Prestigious music colleges were too
            expensive and so he eventually moved to Paris to study the sound
            and film, which helped give him grounding in cinematic
            arrangements. He fell into the city&apos;s nightlife scene, playing live
            instruments in clubs in Paris, and became known as a Soundcloud
            producer who blended house and jazz, as on his vibey 2013 Time For
            A Change EP.</p>
            <p>But then in 2015, he played a festival in the Philippines that
            changed everything. There he met June, who performs as ((( O ))))
            and who he&apos;d remixed a track for. Eventually they got married and
            moved in together on an island off the country&apos;s south coast, where
            they have created a tropical studio idyll that looks out onto lush
            rainforest. You can see it in the live session FKJ recorded there
            in 2019 (over 19m views on YouTube), as he flits between piano,
            singing and sax.</p>
            <p>The seeds for his more introspective sound were sown with his
            2017 self&ndash;titled debut, while the track that he did with Masego
            that same year, &apos;Tadow&apos;, further evidenced his effortless ear for
            intriguing rhythms &ndash; the pair made the hip&ndash;hop&ndash;speared jazz jam out
            of a day&ndash;long improvisation in Paris, duelling on their saxophones,
            their keyboards and drums interlocking effortlessly. There&apos;s an
            ease to his collaborations &ndash; nothing forced; artists who are
            like&ndash;minded about being guided by groove &ndash; see the meeting of minds
            on the track &quot;Risk&apos; with the American rapper Bas or his latest
            remix for PinkPantheress.</p>
            <p>But in 2019, FKJ started drawing more from within. He released
            the Ylang Ylang EP, the result of a tumultuous and devastating year
            when June miscarried. The couple cancelled their commitments and
            holed up together to recuperate and make music. The sweepingly
            romantic jazz of the title track is the EP&apos;s centrepiece, encircled
            by crisp R&B beats, acoustic guitar flourishes and ambitious sax
            instrumentals on the other songs. The making of it soothed them as
            much as it did his growing international fanbase. &quot;With music, I
            feel safe,&quot; he says. &quot;So when I hear that my music is healing for
            people, it&apos;s the best compliment.&quot;</p>

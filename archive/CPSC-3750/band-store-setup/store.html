            V I N C E N T is FKJ&apos;s second album and signals a new dawn where he
            realized he wanted to tap into the freedom of his child-like
            mindset again, where he is making music strictly for playfulness
            and without over thinking.

            deeply on an emotional level for listeners through his
            favourite instrument to play, the piano.

            Drawing its name from the room where the music was made,
            in a remote location in the jungle; FKJ&apos;s 2019 Ylang
            Ylang EP was the result of him relocating himself and
            changing his environment and lifestyle. After months
            staying there, surrounded by beautiful landscapes,
            mountains, and beaches, the EP is a culmination of FKJ&apos;s
            feelings while creating this music.

            FKJ unveils it's first album French Kiwi Juice, and invites us in
            his world. Tribute to his idols, affirmation of musical maturity,
            FKJ goes from Jazz to Soul, with his electronic touch that makes
            his paw incomparable. A warm, reassuring and sensual universe. His
            children's questions (Why are there boundaries), his joys (Blessed
            & Joy), his journeys (Go Back Home & Canggu), the Franco-New
            Zealander delivers himself in an intimate and profound album, with
            music as an universal language.

            Time For a Change resonates as an overwhelmingly groovy ballad!
            Switching from flights of melody (Unchained, Between Moods) to
            downtempo elegies (Instant Need, So Much To Me), nobody remains
            unmoved by the grace of this EP.

            While the previous opus already showed the Tourangeau's scale of
            virtuosity, this new maxi enlightens his capability to showcase the
            other's talent. Collaborating with Madelyn Grant, Jordan Rakei, or
            Damon Trueitt, FKJ succeeds in expressing his own music through the
            voices of accomplished artists.

          <h3>Good Examples</h3>
          <h3>1) Three-Click Rule</h3>
          <p>The three-click rule states that the user should always be three
          clicks away from their desire location for best user-experience. The
          shopping website <a href="https://derschutze.com/">https://derschutze.com/</a>
          effectively demonstrates this rule. The main navigation shows a list of
          links to different pages such as shop, archive, contact, and shipping.
          When a link is clicked, the buyer is directed to the respective page
          that contains the information as described in the link name
          </p>

          <h3>2) Clear and Consistent Navigation</h3>
          <p>It's a must to have clear and consistent navigation for the users
          to be to able to distinguish clickable links which allow them to
          traverse the website. In order to this, the design and placement of
          navigation links should all be same, so the users can intuitively
          find and recoganize them. The Palantir company website
          <a href="https://www.palantir.com/ ">https://www.palantir.com/</a>
          successfully follows this rule. In the website, the clickable links
          are highlight into a different color when the users hover over them.
          The clickable links consistently have the color gray on white
          background and off-white on black background. The website also shows
          the clever use of arrow glyph icon to show the users when a rectangle
          button is pressable.

          <h3>3) Visual Hierarchy</h3>
          <p>Website should use create a clear visual hierarchy to emphasize
          most important content and actionable elements. In order to achieve
          this, a website would need to employ tasteful use of design elements
          such as headings, fonts, and colors. This personal blog website
          <a href="https://wincent.com/blog">https://wincent.com/blog</a>
          illustrates good visual hierarchy. The blog page displays all the
          blog and its content on one page. The blogs are visually separated by
          a large blue clickable title name, and the content of the blog uses a
          smaller fonts that clearly show it's less important than the title.

          <h3>Bad Examples</h3>
          <h3>1) Clear and Consistent Navigation</h3>
          <p>As described before, website should have clear and consistent
          navigation for good user-experience. However, Zara fashion shoppin
          website, <a href="https://www.zara.com/us/">https://www.zara.com/us/</a>
          does not do a good job of having clear and consistent navigation. The
          clickable links on the home page is shown clearly to be clickable
          because the button design stays the same when the mouse is hovered
          over it. Throughout the website, the navigation is relied on clicking
          the hamburger icons to show the link menu. Within the link menu, it's
          unclear that the label bar are draggable to show continuing contents,
          and the clickable links within the menu doesn't seem clear at first
          sight to be clickable. Overall, due to the unclear design of
          clickable link, it'd make it hard for the users to distinguish links
          from normal text, and the only way to do so is to have a change in
          mouse icon design which some users might not have.

          <h3>2) Visual Hierarchy</h3>
          <p>Aforementioned, website should have good visual hierarchy to help
          the users distinguish important content for them to decide their
          actions. The home page of Wayfair website,
          <a href="https://www.wayfair.com">https://www.wayfair.com</a>
          is a poor demonstration of practice. Their homepage is cluttered with
          image boxes and texts in a disorganized manner. The box labels and
          section labels have the same size which makes it hard to distinguish
          which section an element is belonged to. There is no clear
          organized hierarchy in Wayfair's website home page
          </p>

          <h3>3) Web Page Scanning</h3>
          <p>users tend to scan web pages rather than reading every words.
          Therefore, it's important to use clear headings, concise text, and
          meaninful visual elements to make it easy for them to scan and
          recognize what they're looking for. An poor example of this is the
          Yale School of Art website,
          <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu">https://www.art.yale.edu/</a>.
          The website design is inconsistent in font size and visual design.
          Additionally, it's filled with randomly bright color design and
          distracting background. This makes the website to have no visual
          hierarchy and hard to scan and make sense of the webpage.
